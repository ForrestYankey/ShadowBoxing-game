Shadow Boxing
This app simulates a popular game in schools. In the game, two players face off, punching vs dodging. In the real-life version, one player points(punches) in three consecutive directions while the other players moves their head, trying to dodge the punches. If the players punches match the direction the other player dodges three times in a row, they win. 

The rules in the app will be a little different.

Rules:
- The player picks three directions to punch (right, left, up, or down) and the computer dodges.
- If the player matches all three directions verse the computer, that is a knockout and automatic win.
- If they players does not knockout the computers, they get a point for each matched direction and then switch sides.
- Next, the player picks three directions to dodge.
- Same point rules apply to the computer.
- If there are no knockouts, first to 11 wins.
